for responsible disclosure and prompt mitigation.

## Supported Versions

The latest version of Owncast is seen as the supported version. As a small project we are unable to support previous versions and urge users of the software to stay up to date.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue with Owncast, [open an issue](https://github.com/owncast/owncast/issues/new
) on the Owncast GitHub repository and *do not* mention vulnerability details in the issue. If you have a preferred next step on where to discuss the details of the disclosure, please mention that in the issue if it's appropriate for those details to be public.

You may optionally [email Gabe](mailto:gabek@real-ity.com) to alert him directly and provide specifics on how you wish to disclose the details of the issue.

Owncast may open a draft [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory)
  to discuss the vulnerability details in private if it is warranted.
